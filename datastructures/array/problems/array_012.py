Find the Missing Number

Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 7, 8}, N = 8
Output: 5
Explanation: The missing number between 1 to 8 is 5

Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 5}, N = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: The missing number between 1 to 5 is 4

Steps:
1. Create a variable sum = 1 which will store the missing number and a counter variable c = 2.
2. Traverse the array from start to end.
        Update the value of sum as sum = sum â€“ array[i] + c and increment c by 1. This performs the task mentioned in
        the above idea
